# 🎮 Video Game Inventory System — Activity
# Python Dictionaries
# ============================================
#
# You are building a video game inventory management system!
# The player can view, add, use, and manage items across
# multiple categories. The system tracks item names,
# quantities, and stats using dictionaries.
#
# Files in this project:
#   main.py             ← You are here (entry point + menu loop)
#   inventory.py        ← Core inventory management functions
#   shop.py             ← The item shop (buying/selling)
#   player.py           ← Player stats and equipment
#   display.py          ← Display/formatting helper functions
